# Eye of Nemesis
Eye of Nemesis is a Minecraft Paper plugin that allows server admins to write *policies* that will deny or allow (black/whitelist) players to do specific things.

You can create policies based on player location, ~but other types of policies are available, like permission and player-name policy.~ (WIP)
